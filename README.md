#playMusicModes
This is an ear training app focusing on playing and recognizing ancient music modes as well as some other types of scales and modalities.
Cudos to Joren Six for the pitchfinder.js library of pitch detection.

This is still a (really early) work in progress.  The idea is that this app will provide a way for musicians to practice many different types of scales on their instrument and get feedback on note correctness and intonation.

This is an entirely front end JavaScript application.  The core model is in plain js and will be used by the AngularJS based UI.  I am trying to keep the model separate from the framework so it can be easily portet to other frameworks.

To run the project run gulp and browse localhoset:9000

Currently the UI is only used as an output to some model features and acts mostly as a proof of concept.
